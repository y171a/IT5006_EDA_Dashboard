# IT5006_healthcare_dataset_analysis
Repository for Data Analytics Project on University of California, Irvine, (UCI) Machine Learning Repository which contains information on patients with diabetes that represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals. 

Declaration: GPT-AI was used for certain helper functions for data visualization or grouping of methods in this project.

Setup Guide:
1. Create a virtual environment using requirements.txt file --> if you encounter any issues with comorbidiPy library, remove it from the requirements.txt.
2. Access EDA_Preliminary_Data_Profiling.ipynb for raw notebook code for Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Under Section 4 of EDA_Preliminary_Data_Profiling, exists Data Preprocessing logic.
4. df_filtered_first_encounter_mapped.csv is the preprocessed csv output in EDA ipynb file.
5. Streamlit Dashboard is published at https://it5006-grp9.streamlit.app/
6. 3 ML models are explored for the Research Qn: RandomForest, Decision_Tree_Model and RandomForest. Go to the respective ipynb for review.
7. Research Qn: focus on whether a robust predictive model for early hospital readmission — specifically within 30 days — can be developed for diabetic patients during their first recorded encounter.
